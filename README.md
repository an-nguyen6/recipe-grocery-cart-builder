Project idea #1: Create an API to help people plan meals and buy groceries to meet their nutrition goals. 
Take someone’s macronutrient preferences and using a nutrition facts API (FoodData Central) suggest some foods to start
Based on someone’s inputs on basic food/ingredients they’d like to eat, it’ll return recipe suggestions (Spoonacular API)
Based off recipes or food selections, it will call a grocery API (e.g. Kroger, Instacart) to check for food item availability
It may also add items to cart in Instacart using their API 
Wrap all this up in a web app for users to access
